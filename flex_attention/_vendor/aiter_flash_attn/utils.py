# requirement for attn_fwd is exactly BLOCK_M * padded_head_dim_qk * elem_size
# (131072 B for BLOCK_M=128, padded 512, bf16 -- and halving BLOCK_M made it fit),

# Block-sparse pins the kernel tiles to the sparsity granularity, so it cannot use
# triton.autotune -- that would pick its own tiles. The remaining knobs (waves_per_eu
# and friends) are still free, and the best value is strongly per-shape: measured across
# block size, sequence length, head dim and architecture, waves_per_eu swings results by
# up to 2x in *either* direction, and the winner at block 64 is the loser at block 128.
#
# Wrapping the kernel in a second autotuner does work, but costs 8-19 us on every launch
# (triton short-circuits to a lean path only when it holds a single config; with several
# it re-extracts its key and looks up its cache each time). On a 75 us kernel that
# overhead exceeds the win. So: choose once per shape, cache the winner, and let every
# later launch go down the normal lean path.

    NOT YET VERIFIED TO PAY OFF. Correctness is established (the full suite passes with
    it active on gfx942, and selection is one-time: one measurement over 50 calls). What
    is missing is evidence that it is *faster* anywhere. On gfx942 it measures neutral,
    0.94-1.01x over six shapes, which is expected there -- that architecture has little
    headroom, and the forward simply re-picks the default, so both arms run identical
    kernels. The case with real headroom is the gfx950 block-64 backward, where the
    config this selects is worth 1.18-1.32x and no free rule can capture it (the same
    setting is 1.41x slower at head_dim 128). That run is outstanding.
    To settle it: bench/bench_pick_knobs.py on an MI355X node, against the AUTOTUNE=off
    arm. If gfx950 does not show the win, drop this -- it would be the fourth mechanism
    in this area whose overhead exceeded what it recovered.

    ``launch(candidate)`` must run the kernel; it is called repeatedly during selection,
    which is safe because these kernels *store* their outputs rather than accumulating
    into them. A candidate that fails to compile for this shape is skipped rather than
    raising, so an unusable block size just does not get chosen.
