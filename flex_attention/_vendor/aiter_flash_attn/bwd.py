# fused kernel (the only one block-sparse uses) declares it but never reads it -- the
# masked-diagonal sub-blocking it controls is causal-kernel-only.
#
# matrix_instr_nonkdim=16 is worth 1.1-1.6x on the block-sparse backward depending on
# shape (measured across seqlen 2048-8192, block 64/128, head_dim 64/128 on MI300X) and
# was simply never set here -- the tuned dense configs use it, but block-sparse bypasses
# the autotuner to pin its tiles and so inherited none of that tuning. It is dropped
# automatically for blocks below _MFMA_ACC_MIN_K at the launch site, mirroring
# _sanitize_nonkdim.
#
# waves_per_eu stays 1 deliberately. 2 is faster at block 64 / long sequences but much
# slower elsewhere (1.8x at seqlen 8192 block 128, 1.5x at head_dim 128), so it is a
# genuinely per-shape choice, not a better default.
#
# Unlike the forward (see sparse_fwd_default), there is no free rule to key this on:
# on gfx950 a block-64 backward wants waves_per_eu=2 at head_dim 64, by 1.18-1.32x, but
# is 1.41x slower with it at head_dim 128; on gfx942 the same setting only wins at the
# longest sequence. Capturing that needs per-shape measurement -- which is what
# pick_knobs does.

# matrix_instr_nonkdim miscompile workaround -------------------------------------
# The tuned backward configs all set matrix_instr_nonkdim=16. On gfx942 that forces the
# 16x16x16 MFMA, and the AMD Triton backend then miscompiles the accumulating
# `tl.dot(..., acc=...)` in _bwd_dkdv_inner / _bwd_dq_inner when the dot's K dimension
# is <= 16: every loop iteration except the last is silently dropped from dK/dV.
#
# Only the CAUSAL backward hits this, which is why the bug looked causal-specific: the
# diagonal ("masked") blocks are swept with BLOCK_M1 // BLK_SLICE_FACTOR (32 // 2 = 16),
# while the non-causal path uses the full BLOCK_M1 = 32 and is unaffected. Measured on
# MI300X: with nonkdim=16 and a masked block of 16, only the final 16 key positions of
# each K block get correct dV; setting nonkdim to 32, or dropping it so Triton picks the
# instruction itself, makes every position correct. The same applies to the masked dQ
# sweep, which uses BLOCK_N2 // BLK_SLICE_FACTOR.
#
# So drop the hint on any config whose masked sub-block would be <= 16. Configs whose
# sub-blocks stay >= 32 keep it and their tuning.

    is close to its config-tuning ceiling, and the remaining gap to peak is not reachable

    absolute error threshold then accepted configs that silently skipped most of the dQ
